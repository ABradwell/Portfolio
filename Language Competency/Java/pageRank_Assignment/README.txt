This program uses the Google page rank algorithm, implementing it onto a connected Node graph. Each node has an influence rank, which is automaticcaly calculated through the TestPageRank.java file. 

The TestPageRank.java, Graph.java, and CSI2510.java are provided by the professor of the course:

Graph.java || Creates the conected graph of nodes which will be assigned an influence

CSI2510.java || Creates the graphs and prepares them to be tested. Outprints the made graph's nodes

PageRank.java || Incldues my implemented algorithm for  PageRank

TestPageRank.java || Tests the PageRank algorithm on the given graph from CSI2510, using PageRank.java

RUN TestPageRank.java to run algorithm
